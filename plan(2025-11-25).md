# DhakaCart Final Project Plan
**Date:** 2025-11-25
**Based on:** Final Exam_ DevOpsBatch2.pdf

## 1. Project Overview
DhakaCart is a small-to-medium e-commerce site that suffered from downtime and financial loss due to being hosted on a single desktop during traffic spikes. The goal of this project is to migrate DhakaCart to a cloud-based, reliable, scalable, secure, and automated architecture capable of handling 100,000+ concurrent visitors for the upcoming Eid Sale.

## 2. Objectives (Goals)
1.  **Scalability:** Handle 100,000+ concurrent visitors.
2.  **High Availability:** Ensure service continuity despite hardware failures.
3.  **Zero-downtime Deployments:** Implement rolling or blue/green deployments via CI/CD.
4.  **Security & Compliance:** Implement HTTPS, secrets management, RBAC, and network segmentation.
5.  **Monitoring & Logging:** Real-time dashboards, alerts, and centralized logs.
6.  **Backups & DR:** Automated, tested backups and point-in-time recovery.
7.  **IaC & Reproducibility:** Define the entire infrastructure as code using Terraform.

## 3. Recommended Architecture
*   **Cloud Provider:** AWS
*   **Networking:** VPC with public/private subnets, NAT Gateway, Security Groups.
*   **Load Balancing:** Application Load Balancer (ALB).
*   **Compute / Orchestration:** AWS EKS (Managed Kubernetes) or AWS Fargate. (Multi-AZ deployment).
*   **Database:** Amazon RDS (Postgres/MySQL) in private subnet with Multi-AZ.
*   **Caching:** Amazon ElastiCache (Redis).
*   **Storage & Backups:** S3 for static assets and backups; RDS automated snapshots.
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions.
*   **Monitoring:** CloudWatch + Grafana / Prometheus.
*   **Logging:** CloudWatch Logs or ELK/Loki.
*   **Secrets:** AWS Secrets Manager.
*   **CDN:** CloudFront.

## 5. Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Preparation
*   **Goal:** Setup Git repo, Cloud account, and local environment.
*   **Deliverable:** GitHub repo with `docs/` containing project brief.

### Phase 1: Foundation (IaC)
*   **Goal:** Provision VPC, networking, subnets, and security groups using Terraform.
*   **Deliverable:** `terraform/` directory with IaC code and README.

### Phase 2: Containerization
*   **Goal:** Create Docker images for Frontend (React) and Backend (Node/Express).
*   **Deliverable:** Dockerfiles for frontend/backend and locally tested images.

### Phase 3: Orchestration & Deploy
*   **Goal:** Deploy to EKS/Fargate with ALB.
*   **Deliverable:** Running app behind ALB with >2 replicas and health checks.

### Phase 4: CI/CD
*   **Goal:** Automate build, test, and deploy using GitHub Actions.
*   **Deliverable:** Pipeline with ~10 min deploy time and rollback support.

### Phase 5: Monitoring, Logging & Alerts
*   **Goal:** Setup monitoring stack and load testing.
*   **Deliverable:** Grafana dashboards, alert policies, and load test results.

### Phase 6: Security Hardening
*   **Goal:** HTTPS, Secrets Management, Private DB, Vulnerability Scanning.
*   **Deliverable:** Security checklist, ACM certs, Secrets Manager setup.

### Phase 7: Backups & Disaster Recovery
*   **Goal:** Automated snapshots, S3 backups, Cross-region replication.
*   **Deliverable:** Backup policy doc and tested restore procedure.

### Phase 8: Documentation & Handover
*   **Goal:** Runbooks, Architecture diagrams, Troubleshooting guide.
*   **Deliverable:** Final README, Runbooks, Presentation slides.
